Through intimate and personal dissections of her own work, game designer Elizabeth Sampat will explain her process for designing autobiographical games that elicit emotion. Learn to abstract personal experiences— and parts of your own personality— in order to share yourself more fully with your audience. The only way to truly reach out to others is through yourself.
